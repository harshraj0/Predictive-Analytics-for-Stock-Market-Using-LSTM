## Overview

This project aims to predict the future stock prices of Google (GOOG) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time-series data, like stock prices, because they can remember patterns over long periods.

The model is built using Keras with a TensorFlow backend. It is trained on historical stock data from 2014 to 2022 and then tested on data from 2022 to 2024 to evaluate its predictive performance.

## üìà Features

-   **Historical Data**: Fetches over a decade of Google's stock data using the `yfinance` library.
-   **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data cleaning, normalization using `MinMaxScaler`, and preparing the data for the time-series model.
-   **LSTM Model**: Implements a stacked LSTM network with Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
-   **Data Visualization**: Uses `matplotlib` to create insightful visualizations, including moving averages and a comparison of predicted vs. actual stock prices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Python**: The core programming language.
-   **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
-   **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
-   **yfinance**: To download historical stock market data from Yahoo Finance.
-   **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing, specifically `MinMaxScaler`.
-   **Keras (with TensorFlow backend)**: For building and training the LSTM model.
-   **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
-   **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and presentation.
